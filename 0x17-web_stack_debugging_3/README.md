Troubleshooting Apache 500 Error using Puppet
Requirement Summary
In this task, we need to troubleshoot and fix an Apache 500 Internal Server Error using Puppet. We will use strace to identify the issue and then automate the fix using Puppet manifests.

Code Generated
The code generated for this task is a Puppet manifest file named 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp. This file contains the Puppet code required to fix the Apache 500 error.

Code Explanation
To troubleshoot the Apache 500 error, we will use strace to attach to the running Apache process and identify the issue. We can use tmux to run strace in one window and curl in another to simulate the error.

Once we have identified the issue, we will fix it using Puppet manifests. The Puppet code can use any Puppet resource type to implement the fix.

Here is an example of the output before and after applying the Puppet manifest:

Before:

$ curl -sI 127.0.0.1
HTTP/1.0 500 Internal Server Error
Date: Fri, 24 Mar 2017 07:32:16 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu4.21
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
After:

$ puppet apply 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp
Notice: Compiled catalog for e514b399d69d.ec2.internal in environment production in 0.02 seconds
Notice: /Stage[main]/Main/Exec[fix-wordpress]/returns: executed successfully
Notice: Finished catalog run in 0.08 seconds
$ curl -sI 127.0.0.1:80
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 24 Mar 2017 07:11:52 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu4.21
Link: <http://127.0.0.1/?rest_route=/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
As you can see, the Puppet manifest successfully fixed the Apache 500 error, and now the server is returning a 200 OK response.

To implement this solution, you need to create a Puppet manifest file named 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp and add the necessary Puppet code to fix the issue. You can use any Puppet resource type that is appropriate for the fix.

Remember to follow the requirements mentioned earlier, such as having a README.md file, passing puppet-lint, and having the Puppet manifest files end with the .pp extension.

Once you have implemented the Puppet manifest, you can apply it using the puppet apply command, as shown in the example above.

By automating the fix using Puppet, you ensure that the issue is resolved consistently across multiple servers and can easily be managed and maintained in the future.
